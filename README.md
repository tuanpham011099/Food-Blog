If you need to access to admin page, you must have admin account. Follow these steps below
<ul>
  <li>1. You need to provide database connection string - I used Mongodb database</li>
  <li>2. Register an account in register page</li>
  <li>3. Access to you database</li>
  <li>4. Find your account in 'user' model</li>
  <li>5. Change field "is_admin" to true, if you dont see it, then create a new one</li>
  <li>6. Now you can go back and access admin page</li>
  <li>Good luck. If you have problem, contact me through this link: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100014043016988'>This is my FB</a></li>
